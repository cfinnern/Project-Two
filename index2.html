<h2> The Discovery</h2>

 <p> One evening, a cat was found in a garage in a small neighborhood
	 on the Northside of Jefferson Park in Chicago Illinois.
</p>

<h2> The Acceptance</h2>

<p> With the offering of food, she was easily taken into the 
	home of the owners of the garage.
</p>

<h2> The Establishment</h2>

<p> With the replenishing food, the cat, meow named Booger 
	(due to the sickly condition she was in, and the havoc she 
	wrecked in her day to day shenanigans) stuck around
</p>

<h2> The Growth</h2>

<p>The unlimited supply of food and low levels of risk now 
meant that she could eat and then take the well-deserved 
nap after. However, this lack of activity had some negative 
consequences… weight gain. And a lot of it.
</p>

<h2> The Struggle</h2>

<p>The weight gain caused a few struggles in Booger’s life. 
For one, the other animals in the house teased her. But the 
real struggle came with the size increase that is associated 
with weight gain. She doesn’t exactly fit where she once did.
 But as the old saying goes: “If it fits, it sits.”
